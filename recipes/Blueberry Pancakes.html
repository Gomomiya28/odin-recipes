    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Super thick and fluffy blueberry pancakes! Melt in your mouth, golden brown, and bursting with blueberries</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 cup flour</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>1+ cup fresh blueberries</li>
        <li>more butter for the pan</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Preperation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the milk and vinegar and let it sit for a minute or two (you are making “buttermilk” here)</li>
        <li>Whisk the dry ingredients together. Whisk the egg, milk, and melted butter into the dry ingredients until just combined.</li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat. Melt a little smear of butter in the pan (essential for giving a yummy golden brown crust).</li>
        <li>Pour about 1/3 cup of batter into the hot skillet and spread it flat-like (it will be pretty thick). 
            Arrange a few blueberries on top. Cook until you see little bubbles on top and the edges starting to firm up. 
            Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until the pancakes are sky-high fluffy and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Serve with butter and maple syrup. Or any topping of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
