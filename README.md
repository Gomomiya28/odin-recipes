# odin-recipes

In this project I will showcase the skills I have learned within the HTML Fundamentals by creating recipes using these fundamentals. I have created 3 recipes,
namely the, One Pan Chicken & Rice, Blueberry Pancakes and the Vanilla Milkshake. In these HTML files I have used the HTML Boilerplate as a backbone to the file itself.
I then linked each recipe to the index.html file. Within each recipe I havw used both an unorganised list and an organised list. I have also used the paragrapth and heading function.
You will also find an image in each recipe of the desried result. 

This project focuses on HMTL fundamentals put into practice.
